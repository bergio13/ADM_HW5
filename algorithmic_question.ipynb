The proficiency input loop simplifies significantly, as it only iterates N times for the athletes. The inner loop becomes unnecessary since there is only one skill. Therefore, the time complexity of this part becomes O(N).</br></br>2. The result calculation loop also simplifies since there is only one skill. The loop runs once for each skill, and the maximum proficiency is calculated. The time complexity of this part becomes O(M), where M is the maximum number of athletes with that one skill.</br></br>Considering these observations, the overall time complexity for an optimal algorithm when S = 1 becomes:</br> O(N) + O(M)"
